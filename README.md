# Working with [Open Weather's API](https://openweathermap.org/) with Python

The initial program began as a simple python script that I ran in jupyter notebooks. It's actually a constituent of a small collection of scripts in my repository [chatgpt-prompts_problemsolving](https://github.com/phillipashford/chatgpt_prompts_problemsolving) wherein I solved problem prompts to try my hand at a range of tasks.

The original script 'weather_tracker.py' was copied directly from that repository, so that I could expand upon it here.

**Upcoming changes include:**

- Search by city name
- [x] search by zip code
- Add weather warning alerts
- Map of queried location
    - precipitation
    - cloud cover
- Include webcam imagery of location
- Conversion to JavaScript
- Building a webpage to host the script
    - Displaying the forecast with graphics
