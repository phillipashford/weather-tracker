# Working with [Open Weather's API](https://openweathermap.org/) with Python and Javascript

A client-side weather application, using the OpenWeather API.

Initially built a simple version of this in [python]](https://github.com/phillipashford/weather-tracker/blob/main/weather_tracker.py). Converted code to [Javscript](https://github.com/phillipashford/weather-tracker/blob/main/weather_tracker.js) to add features.
