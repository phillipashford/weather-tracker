# Working with [Open Weather's API](https://openweathermap.org/) with Python and Javascript

A client-side weather application, using the OpenWeather API.

I initially built a simple version of this in [Python](https://github.com/phillipashford/weather-tracker/blob/main/weather_tracker.py). Then I converted the code to [Javscript](https://github.com/phillipashford/weather-tracker/blob/main/weather_tracker.js) to add features.

**Upcoming changes include:**

- [x] Convert program to JavaScript
- [x] Search by zip code
- [x] Build a webpage to host the script
    - [ ] Build UI to display map, current weather, climate charts, and forecast 
    - [ ] Display the forecast with graphics
    - [ ] Clicking on map updates data to coordinates of click
- [ ] Search by city name
- [x] Map of queried location
    - [x] precipitation
    - [x] cloud cover
    - [x] temperature
- [ ] Include webcam imagery closest to locale
- [ ] Add weather warning alerts
- [ ] Add climate charts (precipitation and temperature) based on historical data
- [ ] Add selection of API's for user to query from (e.g. NOAA, Openweather, NWS, etc.)
